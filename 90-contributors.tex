\section*{Sofia Mona}

Sofia is studying for a MA in Philosophy at the University of St
Andrews. Originally from Bern, Switzerland, her academic interests
centre on feminist theory, philosophy of mind, and, more recently,
embodied phenomenology.

\section*{Audrey E M Rodriguez}

Audrey is a first-year Philosophy PhD student at the University of
Miami. She began researching love during her undergraduate studies.
She hopes to continue considering romantic love, while expanding to
examine philanthropic love and determine whether it demands further
inquiry in cases of privileged subjects and their resulting ignorance.
She is interested in almost every area of philosophy, but she
especially enjoys feminist philosophy and epistemology of late.
